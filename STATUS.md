# Status

**Last updated: 2026-09-05**

v0 in progress. Target: shipped in under two weeks from 2026-09-05.

## Built and verified

**Deliverable #1 — GitHub setup.** Complete.

- **Project: [Command Center](https://github.com/users/nateprich/projects/2)** (user-owned,
  `#2`, private). Not Project 1 — see `plan.md`, Verification status item 7.
- `Status` single-select: `Ideas → Shaped → Ready → Building → Done → Parked`, in funnel
  order, each with its meaning as the option description.
- `Class` single-select: `Broken → Maintenance → Improve → New → Replace`, in ladder order.
- Labels `needs-shaping` and `blocked` on this repo, and GitHub's ten stock labels
  deleted. That is the complete label set.
- Topic `command-center` on this repo — the funnel's membership gate.

**Time-at-gate is real.** `ProjectV2ItemStatusChangedEvent` observed firing on
`#1` with a usable `createdAt`. The issue-number tiebreak stand-in was never needed.
Evidence in `LEARNINGS.md`.

## Built, not verified

Nothing.

## Not started

| # | Deliverable | Blocked on |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | `funnel.py` — `queue`, `next`, `brief`, with fixture tests on the ordering rules | — ([#1](https://github.com/nateprich-projects/command-center/issues/1)) |
| 3 | `/funnel` skill | #2 |
| 4 | `statusline.sh` — renders the status line, caches both rate-limit windows | — |
| 5 | Codex routine and Claude review routine | #2, #4 |
| 6 | GitHub Actions heartbeat — records outcome, not just liveness | #5 |
| 7 | Onboard this repo as the first member; file remaining work as issues | partly done |

## Blocked

Nothing.

## Open questions

- **Codex's usage signal.** Its equivalent of Claude's `rate_limits` payload is unknown.
  The early-exit gate pattern holds regardless; v0 ships that gate as an explicit
  fail-closed stub.
- **Dependabot** across repos other than `workbench`. A one-time sweep during each repo's
  onboarding.

## Notes

- The v2 design record was never committed to `workbench` — the housekeeping deletion
  `plan.md` called for is void. Confirmed 2026-09-05.
