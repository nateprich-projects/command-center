"""A budget belongs to a provider, not to an agent.

Today the two look identical — Claude has Anthropic to itself, Codex has OpenAI
— which is exactly why the distinction is easy to lose. It stops being true the
moment one subscription serves two harnesses. A z.ai Coding Plan would do that:
GLM implementing in Codex and GLM reviewing in Claude Code draw the same 5-hour
and weekly credits.

The failure that creates is specific. An implementation run that spends the last
of a shared pool leaves its own PR unreviewable, and an unreviewed PR is worse
than an unstarted ticket — the quota is gone and nothing shipped.
